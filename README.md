# HoriseonCodeRefactor

## Description

In this assignment, we were tasked with refactoring a website's code to make it more accessible. Making a website more accessible not only attracts more users and potential customers, but also makes it search engine optimized, meaning search engines will place the website higher on the results list.

Search engine optimization covers a broad spectrum of topics, but this assignment focused primarily on clarity for screen readers. This includes link titles, alt tags for images, text that the readers will understand, organization of layout, and HTML semantic tags.
